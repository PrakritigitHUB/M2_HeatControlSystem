## Introduction
* The Heat Control System is basically used to control the temperature of a car seat. 
* A Heated seats are a standard feature on many vehicles thesedays in cold areas. 
* They provide the driver and passengers with a pleasantly warm seat at all times, even in winter.
* Heated seats are used increasingly in conjunction with climate controlled ventilation, which removes any condensing moisture from the seat.
* When a user or driver gets seated on a car, the button sensor gets activated. After that, the user gets access to turn on the heater. 
* The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller.
* The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication.
* All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.
* The desired temperature is usually set in several levels.
* This can be activated by control of knob which will be allotted for it or by actuating the buttons manually , depending on the configuration installed. 


 ## Objectives

* A flexible approach system.
* The implementation of this project leads for adjusting passenger seat temperatures according to their adjustments.
* Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
* As per the passengers requirement, Heater will generate the heat accordingly when they tune the knob of control.
* It is best for those countries where the room temperature will be below -5 degree Celsius .
