# HEAT CONTROL SYSTEM

## Introduction
* The Heat Control System is basically used to control the temperature of a car seat. 
* When a user or driver gets seated on a car, the button sensor gets activated. After that, the user gets access to turn on the heater. 
* The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller.
* The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication.
* All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.


## Objectives
* To build a system that can receive input and generate output automatically in an easy way and short time.
* To build a control system that is able to monitor and manage all temperature control operations efficiently.
* To maintain security.
* To enter and preserve details of the various issues and keep a track on their returns.
