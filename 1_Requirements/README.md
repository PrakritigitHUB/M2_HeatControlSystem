# HEAT CONTROL SYSTEM

## Introduction
* The Heat Control System is basically used to control the temperature of a car seat. 
* A Heated seats are a standard feature on many vehicles thesedays in cold areas. 
* They provide the driver and passengers with a pleasantly warm seat at all times, even in winter.
* Heated seats are used increasingly in conjunction with climate controlled ventilation, which removes any condensing moisture from the seat.
* When a user or driver gets seated on a car, the button sensor gets activated. After that, the user gets access to turn on the heater. 
* The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller.
* The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication.
* All the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.
* The desired temperature is usually set in several levels.
* This can be activated by control of knob which will be allotted for it or by actuating the buttons manually , depending on the configuration installed. 



## Objectives
* A flexible and easy to handle approach system.
* The implementation of this project leads for adjusting passenger seat temperatures according to their adjustments.
* Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
* As per the passengers requirement, heater will generate the heat accordingly when they tune the knob of control.
* It is best for those countries where the room temperature will be below -5degree Celsius .



## Benefits
* To build a system that can measure the temperature and give response automatically in short time.
* To build a control system that is able to monitor and manage all temperature control operations efficiently.
* To preserve details of the various issues and keep a track of their responses.
* Its simple and easy to use.
* This system is cost effective and user friendly.



## 4W's and 1H

### Who: 
* This is accessed by customers or end users of automobile industry. 
* Passengers who own cars having such technology inbuilt in it can use this effectively.

## What:
* The implementation of this project helps in adjusting passenger seat temperatures according to their adjustments.

## Where: 
* It is used in automobile industries for vehicles like cars.

## When:
* It can be implemented for the counties which are having room temperature less than -5 degree Celsius.

## How:
* By implementing Seat temperature Monitoring System in various automobiles/ vehicles ,it would be helpful in regulating the car seat temperatures.


## SWOT ANALYSIS

### Strengths

* Easy adoptable system.
* We can adjust temperature accordingly in a easier way.
* Flexible Approach
* It's a cost-effective and a robust system.

### Weakness

* Its only applicable for those countries which are having low temperature.

### Opportunities

* We can covert this system to both heater and cooler application.

### Threats

* Doesn't fit good for the places where the temperature is above 20 degree Celsius.
